                  Marathons are a place where people unite and this year we’re all uniting for a cause, depression.
                  Behind this extravagant event is a huge cause we want to spread awareness about. Depression and mental health in Egypt are overlooked and we want to help end the stigma around mental health.
                  Depression is a very strong word that we want to talk about more seriously and take action towards. 
                  People belittle the word depression all the time, when in fact it’s a serious disease like any other disease and it can’t be taken lightly. We want to raise
                  awareness to the people about depression and what it is and how serious it can be.
